## Project Overview
You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice. The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

1. Connecting to an API
2. Parsing the response of the API
3. Handling error cases gracefully
4. Updating information regularly
5. Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
